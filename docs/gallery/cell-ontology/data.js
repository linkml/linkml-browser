This spindle-shaped cell exhibits a unique dual identity, functionally bridging immune and stromal compartments with characteristics of both monocytes and fibroblasts. Predominantly arising from circulating monocytes, it migrates to injury sites via chemokine receptors and participates in wound repair through extracellular matrix deposition, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation via MHC class II. As mesenchymal progenitors, fibrocytes can differentiate into fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and adipocytes, contributing to both physiological repair and pathological fibrosis (Blakaj and Bucala, 2012).",

It is important for the multiple developmental processes including migration, dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis. It typically undergoes programmed cell death following cortical maturation with species- and region specific patterns of survival. In mice, it is predominantly observed in the hippocampal formation, particularly in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (van Bruggen et al., 2023). In contrast, in humans, a second morphologically distinct subpopulation emerges mid-gestation and persists postnatally, with surviving cells observed in the cortical sulci and the hippocampus.",

Because of their structural specialization, a Boettcher cell is believed to play a significant role in the function of the cochlea. They demonstrate high levels of calmodulin, and may be involved in mediating Ca(2+) regulation and ion transport.",

This cell functions in coordination with contractile myoepithelial cells, which aid saliva flow through the ducts into the oral cavity (Khan et al., 2022). In mice and humans, acinar cell development relies on the transcription factor SOX2 (Emmerson et al., 2017), with self-renewal achieved primarily through acinar cell self-duplication and supported by progenitor populations during injury and regeneration (Aure et al., 2016).",

It originates from the olfactory placode during embryonic development and migrates into the forebrain where it localises predominantly in the hypothalamus and in humans, in extrahypothalamic regions like the basal ganglia (Skrapits et al., 2021). This cell regulates reproduction by secreting GnRH into the pituitary portal vessels to induce the release of gonadotropins into the general circulation. It expresses receptor subunits required for AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptor signaling and may use glutamate as a neurotransmitter in recurrent collateral innervation.",

    "definition": "A stromal cell that infiltrates and resides in the kidney interstitium following injury, characterized by the co-expression of CD45 with mesenchymal markers including \u03b1-SMA, and collagen I in humans (Kim et al., 2023). This cell originates from circulating monocyte-derived fibrocytes. It produces extracellular matrix components, contributing to renal fibrosis by potentially differentiating into myofibroblasts upon infiltration into injured kidneys (Sun et al., 2016). Migration into the kidney is dependent on chemokine receptor signaling, particularly CCR2 in mice (Reich et al., 2013).",
